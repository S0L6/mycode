<h1>Mountain Bike Accessories: What You Need to Get Started</h1>
<br>
<h2>Helmets</h2>
<br>
<p>A helmet is arguably the most important safety accessory you can acquire before you hit the trail. Mountain bike helmets offer greater coverage over the occipital and temporal regions than a traditional road bike helmet, and in the case of downhill mountain biking, a full face helmet provides extra protection for the face, chin and mouth.</p>
<br>
<h2>Pedals</h2>
<br>
<p>Mountain bike riding can be done with flat pedals or clip in pedals, the choice is up to the rider. Mountain bike pedals differ to road cycling pedals in that they can be clipped into on both sides, are designed to shed mud and offer a smaller cleat for easier walking.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Clothing</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Mountain bike clothing adds more comfort to your riding. There is more to MTB clothing than the casual look reveals: it’s breathable, flexible so you can move around the bike, often reinforced, and made of a tougher material to prevent ripping should you come off.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Body Protection</h2>
<br>
  <p>As the trails progress and you push your limits, it is wise to pad up with some protective body armour. A pair of flexible knee pads is always a good place to start, from there you can look at combined knee and shin protection, elbow pads and even back protection if you choose.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Gloves</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Mountain bike gloves will usually be full finger length, offering more protection against foliage, scrapes and falls with increased protection across the top of the hand and knuckles. Typically speaking, mountain bike gloves are light on padding so as to offer greater handlebar control and feedback.</p>
