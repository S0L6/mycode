<h1>Components in a nutshell</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Buying a new bike or accessories can often be bewildering to the novice; the folks working in the shop almost seem to be speaking a different language. It's almost as bad as trying to pick out a personal computer!
  
  From our perspective, sometimes it's hard to tell when we're using everyday language and when we're slipping into technical jargon. We have to really ask questions to make sure we're on the same page with a customer and really understand what they are looking for, and often it's just a matter of making sure we agree on the meaning of the words we are using. For example, we sometimes get people asking for a "wheel," when all they really need is a new tire. On the other hand, we've gotten really perplexed looks when we've handed somebody a "rim," when they were really looking for an entire wheel.
  
  So, breaking down the language barrier is an important step in productive relationships between bike shop customers and bike shop employees. To that end, here is a glossary providing a breakdown of the anatomy of the bicycle.</p>
  <h1>Components glossary</h1>
  
  <ul class="b">
    <li>Cage - the preferred fancy name for water bottle holder.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Cassette - the collection of gears that is attached to the rear wheel on most modern bicycles.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Derailer - the device that is bolted to the frame that handles the job of moving the chain from one gear to another when you shift gears. The front derailer handles the shifting on your chainrings and is usually controlled by your left-hand shifter. The rear derailer handles the shifting on your cassette or freewheel, and is usually controlled by your right-hand shifter.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fork - the two-legged part of the frame that holds the front wheel in place. The steerer tube is a part of the fork that extends up into the frame through the head tube.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Frame - the main structural part of the bicycle, commonly made of steel, aluminum, titanium, or carbon fiber.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Rim - the outer "hoop" part of a wheel. Usually made of aluminum, although can be made of steel on some older or low-end bikes, or made of carbon fiber on some high-end racing bikes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Saddle - the preferred fancy word for "seat."</li>
    <br>
    <li>Seatpost - the rod that connects the saddle to the frame.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Stem - the part that connects the handlebar to the frame.</li>
  </ul>
