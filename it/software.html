    <h1>Softwares</h1>
    <br>
    <p>There are different types of software. Mainly there are operating systems and apps. These are different and many types from both topics.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="#OS">Operating Systems</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>Operating systems (OS) are what run your computer on a daily basis and make you able to use it. Operating systems can be flashed to a USB through <a href="#app">apps</a>. These then can be used to install an operating system to any computer. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>There are many types of operating systems.
      Firstly the most used OS as of June 2021 72.98% of 
      people were using Windows 10. This is the most popular OS becasue 
      it is easy to use and taught at
       many schools. They are also most commonly sold with 
       <a href="laptops.html">laptops</a>
        and <a href="desktops.html">desktops</a>. It also runs every <a href="#app">app</a> that most people need. If you do decide to build a PC windows cost about AUD$200 to buy. Windows isn't as customisable than Linux.</p>

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Linux on the other hand is alot more complicated because most things are in command line (CLI). Only 2% of people with computers use linux. It is very customisable but at the cost of difficulty. Threre are two types of linux ditriputions, desktop enviroments and server enviroments. server enviroments are generally more complicated becasue most of them have no gui (Graphics User Interface). These can run autonomous operations and host websites</p>
