# School Project - Term 3
## Information Technology

This is a school project where you have to create a web page on anything and I chose to test my knowledge on computers and guide people on what they do. There are many sub categories in the main topics in the nav bar. This website was created from scratch and may contains content sourced from other websites. I am just using my knowledge of these subjects and some information from online.
